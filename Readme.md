# Stone-Paper-Scissors
## Summary
Using mediapipe, we collectedÂ a large amount of data in the form of hand landmarks. To predict the user's movement, a Deep Neural Network model was developed using the landmark data.
When players play the game, the frames are transferred to the backend, where the hand landmarks are obtained using mediapipe. The user's movement is then predicted using the pre-trained Deep Neural Networks model.
The fundamental rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors apply:
Scissors are defeated by Rock.
Scissors thud paper.
Paper is defeated by Scissors.
